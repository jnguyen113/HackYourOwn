        on your answers to our questionnaire, we match you up in groups of
        similar experience and interests, and have you code two projects, one
        orientation project (will allow you to get to know your group members
        through a small one-week project) and a
        {" "}
        <b>capstone</b>

        project (1 week of planning, 9 weeks of coding, one presentation).
