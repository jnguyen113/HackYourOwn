        Due to COVID-19, tens of thousands of Computer Science internships have
        been canceled, leaving students stranded. While many have turned to
        developing their own projects to fill the void, self-study lacks a few
        crucial components of the internship experience - mentoring and feedback
        from professionals. Hack Your Own aims to add this extra dimension. By
        participating, you&apos;ll join a community of like-minded peers to
        design and build high-impact open source projects while receiving
        mentorship and guidance from experienced developers. Think of it as an
        intensive summer senior design course supported by industry advisors.
